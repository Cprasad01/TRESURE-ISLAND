# TRESURE-ISLAND
The game begins with the player at a crossroads. The player can choose to go left or right. If the player goes left, they come to a lake with an island in the middle. The player can choose to wait for a boat to the island or swim across. If the player chooses to wait for a boat, they arrive at the island safely. If the player chooses to swim, they get attacked by an angry trout and the game ends.

If the player arrives at the island safely, they come to a house with three doors: red, yellow, and blue. The player can choose which door to open. If the player opens the red door, they enter a room full of fire and the game ends. If the player opens the yellow door, they find the treasure and win the game. If the player opens the blue door, they enter a room of beasts and the game ends. If the player chooses a door that doesn't exist, the game ends.

If the player goes right at the crossroads, they fall into a hole and the game ends.



The code uses a number of Python features, including:

 ->Strings: Strings are used to represent the text of the game, such as the descriptions of the player's surroundings and the choices they are presented with.
->Conditionals: Conditional statements, such as if and elif, are used to control the flow of the game based on the player's choices.
->Functions: Functions are used to encapsulate reusable code, such as the code to display the player's surroundings or to check if the player has won the game.
